# week-2-DA
VBA Challenge, Due August 31st

This VBA script iterates all the the worksheets and process the data to analyze it by  ticker, including yearly change,
percentage change and Total Stock Volume.

The first three images show the worksheets before the script being executed. If you look at the "2018-Pre-Analysis.png" image you will notice the button that executes the script

This image shows the first few lines of the script about to be executed on the whole file,
including all worksheets

This is how the file looks like after the script has been executed (it takes around 3 minuts to execute this script due to the huge amount of data)

![Alt After-Execution](image https://github.com/salvarenga25/week-2-DA/blob/main/Screenshots/Execution-Complete.png?raw=true)

Finally, this is how the worksheets look after the analysis is complete
